<p>Null the open source community is starting with the new era by introducing the null 2.0. We would like to thank all the members and volunteers who made this possible. It wonâ€™t be wrong to call this community is volunteer-driven and this is essentially the strong essence of an open-source community. The idea of building such a community was to grow and learn together. We initiated the idea of an open security community in India with the null chapter in Pune back in 2008, and we got a great response from the people who were enthusiastic about cybersecurity, and then in 2010, Null was registered as a non-profit society. Since then null has been actively contributing by making people aware of information security and is proudly introduced as Indiaâ€™s largest open security community. To the people who contributed to this community with an open mind and a big heart, we would thank you for being there with us and you always have the support of this community. With that being said letâ€™s start this new era of null with a higher motive of making this community bigger and more approachable to the people all around the globe.</p>
