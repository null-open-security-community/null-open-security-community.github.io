I"<p>We at null Delhi had many participants (especially the new comers in the field of hacking and security) ask basic questions about CTFs like what is CTF? How to participate in CTF contests? What kind of skills are required? so and so forth since the time of nullcon V earlier this year. While we were answering those questions we found a need of a real time challenge which we can put in front of attendees and they can probably play around with it to find the answers themselves. During this course we decided to put different challenges in front of the attendees related to various domains of security (reverse engineering, web application hacking, cryptography, forensics, operating systems, etc.) and ask them to solve these challenges at the venue itself. They can take assistance from the mods and their neighbors or do it themselves. After every challenge we would cover a detailed walkthrough which would not only focus on the solution of the particular challenge but would also clarify the concepts of techniques to be used during CTFs.</p>
