I"ñ<p>I have always been saying that â€œThe best things in the world are for free â€¦.fresh air, sunlight, friends, Linuxâ€¦â€¦â€ ğŸ˜€</p>

<p>Here is some free stuff from Microsoft (not joking ğŸ˜€ ), but whether it will be best, Im doubtful. After Windows Defender which is a free Anti-Mal-ware from Microsoft, it is now coming up with a new single step security solution for Windows users, code named Morro. Morro is to succeed One Care, the paid version of Microsoftâ€™s security offering.</p>
