<p>Delhi â€“ The Second Adventure</p>

<p>Joerg Simon was back in Delhi on 27th July (Saturday) which he named his second adventure after a gap of 10 months. The last time he was in Delhi was for NullCon Delhi, 2012 with his talk on Fedora Security lab, OSSTMM. He could not complete his talk last time because he messed up his own time. It was a wonderful opportunity for everyone to meet to meet him personally and share and learn things about Open Source Security.</p>
