I"§<p>Ok, the name is a pun on Titanâ€™s watch ðŸ˜› and is something that is an outcome of a really cool bash feature which Iâ€™ll be discussing. Bash provides a way to create a TCP connection or send UDP packets to a host on  a given port, the cool thing is that you donâ€™t have to rely on other scripting languages or programs for creating sockets/network connections when writing a shell script. Using this feature one can write simple to complex network utilities/scripts (a sigh of relief for scriptters :-) if that is that a word ).
NOTE: This is a bash provided feature(if it is compiled with â€“enable-net-redirections option) and has nothing to do with /dev Devices.</p>
