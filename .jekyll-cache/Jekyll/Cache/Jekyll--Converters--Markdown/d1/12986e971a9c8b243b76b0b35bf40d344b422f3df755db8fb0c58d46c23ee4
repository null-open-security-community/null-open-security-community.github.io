<p>Well I personally would like to thank Swaroop for giving the session, but at the same time expect more talks from him so that we can continue with the next concepts in Wireless Security.</p>

<p>The First Part of the Humla, was the Basics of Wireless Security. In the coming parts we plan to have Advance Concepts in Wireless Security and Hacking.</p>

<p>I would also like to call upon fellow mates in the mailing list to participate in the next Parts of the Series. Timely Announcement would be made on the mailing list about the session, and people would be invited to register for the next part. Active participation from you all will help us to make it more successful.</p>

<p>Keep Hacking…and Sniffing… :)</p>
