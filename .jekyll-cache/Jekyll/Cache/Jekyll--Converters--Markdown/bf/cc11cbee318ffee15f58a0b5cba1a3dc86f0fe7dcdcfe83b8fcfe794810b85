I"y<p>I often get asked by many people on how we discover new vulnerabilities or code exploits. So, finally I decided to spend some time and make a small tutorial on what vulnerability research is all about. <!--more--> Well, it’s not a tutorial as such, more of an introduction. But I have covered all aspects of it – right from discovery to exploit creation process. I have made this three part series on discovering ActiveX vulnerability using fuzzing. This tutorial could serve as good “jump start” to all the folks looking to get into Fuzzing and vulnerability research.</p>
