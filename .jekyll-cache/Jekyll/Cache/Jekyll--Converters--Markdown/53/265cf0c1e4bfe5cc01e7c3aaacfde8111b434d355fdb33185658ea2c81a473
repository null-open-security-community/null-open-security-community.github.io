  </li>
  <li>

<p>The IT Icon of Pune ‚Äì Depak Shikarpur:</p>

<p>Deepak Shikarpur had mentioned said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIn my child hood I saw two films back 2 back Pandu Havaldar and James Bond. and had thought when will our Pandu Havaldar will become James Bond? And Im pleased to tell that with the modernisition, technology and the new outlook of these dedicated cops, Yes we feel that our cops are no less then James Bond‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&lt;Yes Sir!!! we all agree with you on that&gt;.</p>

<p>The Chief ‚Äì Dr. Satya Pal Singh :</p>

<p>Addressing the COPTech Forum Dr. Satya Pal Singh read out another lottery mail which he recieved on his black berry and challanged the corporates to come up with better SPAM filters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIts like a marriage of Police Department and Technology. And the relation is dominated by the stronger party. The technology is stronger party and hence department has taken up this challange to make better use of technology and work in smart, effective and efficient manner.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also made an early announcement of a new modern Forensic lab in Pune which will be probably best in the country</p>

<p>&lt;Tentative date of official inauguration is 7th Oct. but department is yet to find some chief guest to inaugurate it&gt;</p>

<p>Vote of Thanks :
Mr. Tungar thanked the Corporates, Dignities and NULL members present for the Meet.</p>

<p>We null members had a good long discussions with Mr.Tungar on their day today challanges, non-cooperation, loose operations of IT and Telecom industry etc.  He also discussed a famous case where a person was victim of digital evidences which were against him and how they solved the case based on their experience with humans and not with machine. We had a great time with him.</p>

<p>With sips of coffe, crackles of wafers and sweetness of Gulabjaumns, we were indulged in networking with many other eminent IT personalities present at Cop-Tech.</p>

<p>It was a great event. We were amazed by the humbleness of Police department and there drive to achieve technical excellence right from operations to dealing politely with tax payers.</p>

<p>Dr. Satyapal Singh told</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúControl room daily recieves thousands of calls. 75% of which are irrevelent, miss guiding or just to ask some lame address. But still would like our force to work under cool and improve on their soft skills.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously this event has increased my respect for Police force and has motivited me (rather all nulls) to contribute in this drive called COP-Tech‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Enjoy,</p>
