I"X<p>When we started null – The Open Security Community, we didn’t really plan beyond the monthly gathering of infosec peeps and enthusiasts in cities like Pune and Bangalore.</p>

<p>We didn’t ask for registration, take any attendance (beyond a cursory head count) and things were swell.</p>

<p>What we didn’t really think about (atleast I didn’t) was that we would still be doing this with enthusiasm and passion 5 and 1/2 years after we started. It is quite natural to start thinking about the next level after gaining proficiency in doing security related events month after month.</p>
