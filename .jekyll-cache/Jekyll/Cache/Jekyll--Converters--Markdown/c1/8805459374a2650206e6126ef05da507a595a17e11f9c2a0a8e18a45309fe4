<p>From our <a href="https://blog.null.co.in/first-official-null-meet/">humble beginnings in 2008</a> we have grown leap and bounds. However, numbers don‚Äôt do justice to what null has achieved, so this year we approached each and every chapter and asked them to outline what they did in 2018. Anything that they considered worth sharing is what they discussed and is outlined in the post. We have budding chapters like Ahmedabad and Bhopal where the majority of the attendees are students to mature chapters like Bangalore, Mumbai, Singapore, Dubai and more were mostly professionals‚Äô venture. All of them have taken initiative beyond just organizing meetups to serve as a knowledge sharing community.</p>

<p>This post will outline what null chapters have done over the entire year in 2018 and will be celebrating the joy of giving back.</p>

<p>Here is what each of our chapters had to say about what they were up to (strictly in alphabetical order).</p>

<h1 id="ahmedabad"><strong>Ahmedabad</strong></h1>

<p>First of all, we would like to thank all the null core community members who have approved null Ahmedabad to establish it as a chapter. We consider this as our biggest achievement. We conducted our first puliya session this year. Within 11 months, 12 events were conducted out of which 11 were meets and 1 was public puliya session. Out of 46 sessions, 23 unique speakers presented. Apart from the regular events:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Jaimin Gohel and Bhashit Pandya conducted multiple CTF challenges post meetups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We supported Defcon Dehradun conducting an online session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unique hands-on workshop on lock picking and hardware hacking was conducted by Namrata Brahmkshatriya and Ravi Rajput respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>null Ahmedabad also participated in Kaspersky CTF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting from the handful of people, we reached 60 registration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few students and people from non-security background came up and presented like Sanjay Makwana, Parth Jankhariya, Chinmay Patel, Kuldeep Pandya, Bhuvan Gandhi, Vishal Patel and Manju Chufal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an absolute privilege to have Amish Patadiya, Savan Ahmedabad for multiple meets and our 1st Puliya conducted by Kartik Lalan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is all the joint efforts of the team and supporters. 2018 has been a year of learning but it is just the beginning. Cheers!</p>

<h1 id="mumbai"><strong>Mumbai</strong></h1>

<p>As our community is growing bigger day by day, being an open security
community we are trying to maintain the quality of content high along
with passing a sense of responsibilities to the participants to
contribute back to the community.</p>

<p>We have hosted a total 20 Event (63 Sessions) this year which includes 12
Open monthly meets, 2 Humla hands-on sessions, 3 Puliya session and 3
security workshops.</p>

<p>We witnessed diverse participation from industry professionals, academic
institutes, government agencies and independent consultants. We have
also witnessed the participation from corporates for providing the venue
and required resources for hosting the open security meets and hands-on
session. Few of the companies even went ahead and mandated the
participation of our community for their employees to gain the knowledge
as well as giving back the knowledge.</p>

<p>This year we attempted to bridge the skills gaps which industry is
facing by introducing industry professionals to our community and at the
same time by introducing the college students to such professionals for
an internship or full-time opportunities. We have many student
participants which got an internship or got permanently placed at
reputed organizations.</p>

<p>We tried covering the diverse security topics this year including

<h1 id="pune"><strong>Pune</strong></h1>

<p>This was a good year for null Pune. We conducted 10 events in 2018 (8
meets and 2 workshops). We had a total of ~400 RSVPs (we really had
some outstanding turnouts with 45+ people some days) and an average 3
sessions per meet. A mix of students and professionals attend and
present in Pune. We even mentor some students from the first year of
college. We did some great sessions with a variety of topics including

where attendees learned from the experiences of speakers. Similar to the
Bangalore chapter we had a WINJA meet in the first week of January 2019
which had a great turnout, interactive quizzes and CTF. Looking into the
next year we plan on having multiple Puliya sessions based on the
response from the community and CTFs to correlate with sessions.</p>

<h1 id="singapore"><strong>Singapore</strong></h1>

<p>null Singapore Chapter is currently the largest security community in
Singapore with over 1600 members. We have organized 4 meetup and 3
workshop events in 2018. At null Singapore, we have interesting
participation from members with a wide range of expertise including
developers, pentest, hardware security, crypto experts, product
security, network security operations, and more. We are pleased to host
null community booths in well-known conferences here such as Blackhat
and HITBGSEC and spread the awareness about our activities.</p>

<p>We have amazing support from the local companies in Singapore to host
our event. In 2018, most of our events were hosted at Grab, Zendesk, and
Cloudflare.</p>

<h1 id="way-forward"><strong>Way Forward</strong></h1>

<p>It‚Äôs inspiring to see how all these chapters have been working
tirelessly towards the propagation of knowledge and bringing awareness
about information security at grassroots. Each chapter has done
something different to connect with the local community. The testament
to the efforts in the event archive page which is arguably one of the
largest information security archives with base in India:
<a href="https://null.co.in/event_sessions"><span class="underline">https://null.co.in/event_sessions</span></a>.
One can pick any topic under the sun on information security and can
hopefully find at least one session that was delivered at a null chapter.</p>

<p>The way forward for the community is to keep surpassing our own
achievements and reach new heights, there are hundreds of unexplored
possibilities and scenarios which will only be possible when people join
hands. So this blog post should also be considered as a request to step
forward and suggest what more we can do to help the world be a better
place.</p>

<p>Please reach out to your respective chapter leaders or the null
community managers for any feedback.</p>

<p>In case, your local region does not have a chapter and you want to start
a new chapter to promote infosec learning, <a href="https://null.co.in/pages/3-how-to-start-a-chapter">visit this page</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Learning</p>
