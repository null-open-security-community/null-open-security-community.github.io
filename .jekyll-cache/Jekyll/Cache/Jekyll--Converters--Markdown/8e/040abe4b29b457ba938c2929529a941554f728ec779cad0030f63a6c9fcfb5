I"í<p>It was 5:30 PM, I was sitting in my cube lazying around, doing nothing and suddenly it dawned on me, Why not pwn our own site (empty mind is devilâ€™s workshop :P). I started to write a small html page that had the most common features of a defaced page, black background, red font, st3r30typ1c4l 4lph4b3t. At the end of the file I had put a message in black font color just to see if ppl take the time to go through the source of the page, actually also to prove that it was not an actual defacement :-P, which was a more factor. I asked Ajit for a code name for the defacer and he suggest the mock of Indiaâ€™s biggest H4ck3r ever (yeah u guessed it right :-P, The Lamer).  I deliberately pointed corrupt to the website and he understood that it was a prank and simultaneously sanyal also got to know about it. Abhijeet and Rohan fell for it and talked to Corrupt and Antz(who assumed it to be a prank). I had advised everyone who knew about it not to tell anyone else, not even the moderators.</p>
