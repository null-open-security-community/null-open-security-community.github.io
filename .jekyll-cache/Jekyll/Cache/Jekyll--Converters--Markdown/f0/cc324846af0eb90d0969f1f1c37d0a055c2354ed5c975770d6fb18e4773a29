I"´<p>This is a personal account of Sudhir Babu who attended the null Bangalore Browser Fuzzing Humla session taken by null Humla champion Anil Aphale.</p>

<p>I had an amazing experience last Saturday at Null Humla â€œBrowser Fuzzingâ€ session. â€œBrowser Fuzzingâ€?? It was an alien concept for me, I did some work with Java script previously but I never understood why my browser ever crashed; most of the times I just ignored it</p>
