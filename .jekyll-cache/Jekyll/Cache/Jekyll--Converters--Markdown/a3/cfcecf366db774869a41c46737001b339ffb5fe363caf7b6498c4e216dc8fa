    <p><strong>A null Humla event is led by 1-2 champions in that particular topic</strong>
One or two hackers who have the experience and skills are assigned as Humla Champions for a particular topic. They are completely responsible for the course content and ensuring that all the group members learn the concepts and the attacks.</p>
