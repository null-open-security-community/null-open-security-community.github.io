<p>As sas3 mentions, ‚ÄúMy first skiing lesson was *how to get up when you fall.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The instructor felt compelled to explain: ‚Äú_Buddy, you‚Äôre gonna fall. Many times. So until you become an expert skiier this is going to be one skill you‚Äôll need a lot. Even after that, I‚Äôll be damned if you don‚Äôt fall once in a while ‚Ä¶ unless you give up skiing of course and choose to fall in your frozen parking lot.‚Äù.</p>

<p>Openness and knowledge sharing being some of the core ideas behind null, having contributors to the null blogs with the old implementation (wordpress; dont ask) was a problem which can now be solved by just a git pull request :)</p>
