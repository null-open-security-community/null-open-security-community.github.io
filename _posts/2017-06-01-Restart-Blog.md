null is India's largest open security community. Registered as a non-profit society in 2010, we have been active since even before that. null is about spreading information security awareness. All our activities such as null Monthly Meets, null Humla, null Bachaav, null Puliya, null Job Portal are for the cause of that.

As sas3 mentions, “My first skiing lesson was *how to get up when you fall."

> The instructor felt compelled to explain: "_Buddy, you're gonna fall. Many times. So until you become an expert skiier this is going to be one skill you'll need a lot. Even after that, I'll be damned if you don't fall once in a while ... unless you give up skiing of course and choose to fall in your frozen parking lot.”. 

Yes, we failed to make a good decision before; (evidence, defacement of null website ;))

Openness and knowledge sharing being some of the core ideas behind null, having contributors to the null blogs with the old implementation (wordpress; dont ask) was a problem which can now be solved by just a git pull request :)
